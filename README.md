Module 4-Homework

Written Report
	One observable trend based on the data is that students who attend charter schools have a greater chance of passing math and reading. For charter schools, the over all passing rate is about 90%, compared to 53% for district schools. Charter school students scored better than district schools in math and reading.
	A second obersvable trend is that, suprisingly, the more money a school spends per studnet, the lower the overall percent passing is. This is the opposite of what I would expect to be the case and warrants further research to determine why this is. 


Code
	The code for this assignment can be found in the PyCitySchools directory and is called PyCitySchools_starter.
	When not sure what code to use or how to use it, I refered to class notes, instructor examples,  and, per instructor recommendation, utilized ChatGPT to help learn how to do it. Otherwise, no other code or outside resources were used.
